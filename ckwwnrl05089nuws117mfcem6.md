## Can I participate in Web3 as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer?

**Short answer:** Yes, you can.

**Long answer:** There is a tremendous amount of data generated by blockchain transactions. This on-chain data is pseudonymous. Therefore it requires Data Science to decipher and break down this information at scale. 

Indexing Protocols like [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) are working on enabling querying and making this data searchable. Others are on a mission to make this data more accessible and visible, such as [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/).

To give yourself an idea of how many transactions are created each day, you can check out this real-time tracker of the Bitcoin network: https://www.blockchain.com/charts

Over time, aggregating this data and interpreting it will be vital for companies, DAOs, governments, or other organizations to analyze markets and trends. I also predict that when more intersections of Machine Learning and Web3 occur, we will be seeing more and more data science and research positions.
