## [Tutorial] How to Create Your Own Digital Planner On GoodNotes 5

2021 is just around the corner, and I am already looking for ways to make next year a little less chaotic than this one.

After going through several planner formats from a plain notebook, the Pro Clever Fox planner, and most recently, the built-in Reminders app on iOS, I have found that they all don't satisfy my needs.

GoodNotes 5 has become my latest solution. At $7.99 on the App Store, this application has become my paper and pencil replacement. The most notable features are the ability to create notebooks from custom or pre-built templates, view your creations on different devices with iCloud integration, an easy-to-use interface, and a customizable set of drawing tools.

**Disclaimer:** Before you keep reading, this is **NOT** a coding tutorial. This tutorial explains how to create your custom-designed digital planner on the GoodNotes 5 app. Unfortunately, this app is only available on the Apple App Store.

Also, this tutorial is **NOT** sponsored... I just really love this app.

### What you will need:

- A pdf editor or application that supports pdf files [Microsoft Word, Adobe Illustrator, Indesign, Affinity Designer, etc.]
- GoodNotes 5 App downloaded on an iPad or MacBook

### Instructions:

1. **Design your page templates as letter-sized (8.5 x 11 inches) pdf documents.** For this part, I recommend finding color palettes, patterns, and designs you enjoy to personalize your planner. ![Screenshot 2020-12-30 124316.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1609357531949/ugneseqKH.png)

2. **Ensure each different type of page you create is in a separate pdf file.** If they are not, you can [separate them with Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/how-to/split-pdf-pages.html) or this online tool: https://www.ilovepdf.com/split_pdf
